# light-config-dev
Default config files of light-java and light-java-rest for dev environment for light-config-server.
For your own project from another organization, you can setup an organization wide default as
light-config-dev in your github organization in order to overwrite some of the config files from
default.

Each service/app built on top of light-java and light-java-rest can have its own config repo
identified by serviceId in order to provide service/app specific config files and overwrite
default config files inherited from organization or networknt.

This folder contains docker-compose and config to start the light-router for light-portal services for test and UI development.

It is used for the UI to use the proxy or for the test build to deploy to the rotuer to do the test in the cloud. 

For all the portal service we are going to use the docker-compose to start all of them. 

There are two configuration folders. 

config is the main folder which is used by the docker-compose.yml on test1 server for lightapi.net

dev is the folder for local portal veiw developers that is used by the docker-compose-dev.yml on the the test2 server for dev.lightapi.net

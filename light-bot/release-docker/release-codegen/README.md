### The purpose of this config

The config files in this folder publishes light-codegen docker images to docker hub for each release. This should 
be done after the release-maven task for all modules and all jar files can be access from maven central. 

light-codegen is not included the release-all as it is built in docker and jar files from maven central won't be 
available immediately after release-maven task. 


### Prepare the environment

This is a one time work and all other tasks in light-config-test won't need to do it again. If this is your first
time to use light-bot, then you need to checkout both light-bot and light-config-test repository to a workspace.

I am using networknt under my user home directory as workspace and all scripts are based on that assumtpion. If
you want use another folder as your workspace, please fork the light-config-test repo and update the scripts
accordingly. 

```
cd ~
mkdir networknt
git clone https://github.com/networknt/light-bot.git
git clone https://github.com/networknt/light-config-test.git
cd light-bot
./gradlew build
```

Now you should have light-bot built already. 

### To start the command line

```
java -Dlight-4j-config-dir=./config -Dlogback.configurationFile=./logback.xml -jar ~/networknt/light-bot/bot-cli/build/libs/bot-cli-fat-1.0.jar -t release-docker
```
